# Not-Worth-Looking

<h1> Welcome to my Git </h1>
<br/> 
<b> Its really not worth checking out.</b>
<p><h4> so this git is all about experiments and motivating myself to do learn as much as I can, I dont think anything from here can really help anyone, but hell if it does its not my fault.
so here you go, that's all I've done till now: <br/>
nothing<br/>
